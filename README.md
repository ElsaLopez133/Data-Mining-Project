# Data mining

This project consist of two main parts.
* Part A: a query recommnedation system
* Part B: the calculation of the importance of a query to a user

Both are presented in the form of python notebooks. To ensure these will run, make sure your python enviornment fulfills the requirements listed in requirements.txt.
From here, import the source code into your prefered notebook enviornment and add the data files into a folder called "data_house" in the root of your project. Now run all cells for each notebook.
